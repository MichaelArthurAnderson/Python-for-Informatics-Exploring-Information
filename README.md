# Python for Informatics Exploring Information

To re-enforce the Python classes I've been taking on Coursera, I'm working through the exercises in the book "Python for Informatics: Exploring Information" which is available here:  http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php .  

While there may be other ways to complete each exercise, I'm following the book in order and each example will only utilize techniques introduced up to that point in the text.

Exercises were completed with version 0.0.9-d2 (English PDF) and Python 2.7.5 on a Mac running OS X 10.9.5.
