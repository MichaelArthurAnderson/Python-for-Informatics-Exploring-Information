# Python-for-Informatics-Exploring-Information

To re-enforce the Python classes I've been taking on Coursera and my graduate school assignments, I'm working through the exercises in the book Python for Informatics: Exploring Information which is available here:  http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php .  

Exercies were completed with version 0.0.9-d2 (English PDF) and Python 2.7.5 on a Mac running OS X 10.9.5.
