#  Exercise 6.4 There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise. Read the documentation of this method at docs.python.
# org/library/string.html and write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in 'banana'.
#
# Note:  While there may be other ways to complete this exercise, I'm following the book in order.  Each example will only untilize techniques
# introduced up to that point in the text.
