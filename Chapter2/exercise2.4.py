# Python for Informatics Exploring Information
# Exercise 2.4 Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).
# 1. width/2
# 2. width/2.0
# 3. height/3
# 4. 1 + 2 * 5
# Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.
#
# Note:  While there may be other ways to complete this exercise, I'm following the book in order.  Each example will only utilize techniques
# introduced up to that point in the text.
